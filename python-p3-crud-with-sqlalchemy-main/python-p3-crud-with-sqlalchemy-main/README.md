# Create, Read, Update, and Delete with SQLAlchemy

## Learning Goals

- Use an external library to simplify tasks from earlier ORM lessons.
- Use SQLAlchemy to create, read, update and delete records in a SQL database.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Schema**: the blueprint of a database. Describes how data relates to other
  data in tables, columns, and relationships between them.
- **Persist**: save a schema in a database.
- **Engine**: a Python object that translates SQL to Python and vice-versa.
- **Session**: a Python object that uses an engine to allow us to
  programmatically interact with a database.
- **Transaction**: a strategy for executing database statements such that
  the group succeeds or fails as a unit.
- **Migration**: the process of moving data from one or more databases to one
  or more target databases.

***

## Introduction

In the previous lesson, we created and persisted a database schema using
SQLAlchemy. This required us to define classes that inherited from a common
`declarative_base` object and that possessed certain attributes that would be
used to assign a table name, columns, primary keys, and more.

In this lesson, we'll be building on the same schema. The code from last
lesson's code-along can be found in `app/sqlalchemy_sandbox.py`. Run
`chmod +x app/sqlalchemy_sandbox.py` to make it executable.

> **Note**: we are using a SQLite database in memory now instead of a
> `students.db` file. This will allow us to make changes to our schema without
> running into issues. We will learn how to address changing a schema when we
> discuss **migrations** later in this module.

***

## The Session

SQLAlchemy interacts with the database through **sessions**. These wrap
**engine** objects like the one we included in our script in
`sqlalchemy_sandbox.py`. The session contains an **identity map**, which is
similar to an empty dictionary with keys for the table name, columns, and
primary keys. When the session pulls data from `students.db`, it fills the
identity map and uses it to populate a `Student` object with specific attribute
values. When it commits data to the database, it fills the identity map in the
same fashion but unpacks it into a `students` row instead.

### `sessionmaker`

To create a session, we need to use SQLAlchemy's `sessionmaker` class. This
ensures that there is a consistent identity map for the duration of our session.

Let's create a session in `sqlalchemy_sandbox.py` so that we can start executing
statements in `students.db`:

```py
# app/sqlalchemy_sandbox.py

#!/usr/bin/env python3

from datetime import datetime

from sqlalchemy import (create_engine, desc,
    Index, Column, DateTime, Integer, String)
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

Base = declarative_base()

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'

    id = Column(Integer(), primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

    # use our engine to configure a 'Session' class
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    # use 'Session' class to create 'session' object
    session = Session()
```

Run `app/sqlalchemy_sandbox.py` to persist your schema and create a session.
You won't see anything yet, but it's always wise to stop and check for errors
after you change the functionality of your code.

### Transactions

**Transactions** are a strategy for executing SQL statements via ORM that
ensure that they all succeed or fail as a group. This is especially important
if statements that occur later on depend on earlier statements executing
properly. The workflow for a transaction is illustrated in the image below:

![Workflow for a successful transaction. Shows that after a transaction begins,
the state of the database is recorded, then statements are executed, then the
transaction is committed if all statements are successful.](
https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/python/esal_0401.png "successful transaction")

If any of the SQL statements in the above image fail to execute properly,
the database will be rolled back to the state recorded at the beginning of the
transaction and the process will end, returning an error message.

### Refactoring our Schema

Before we begin transactions on our database, let's take a moment to build upon
the `Student` model from the previous lesson:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# imports

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'

    Index('index_name', 'name')

    id = Column(Integer(), primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String())
    email = Column(String(55))
    grade = Column(Integer())
    birthday = Column(DateTime())
    enrolled_date = Column(DateTime(), default=datetime.now())

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Student {self.id}: " \
            + f"{self.name}, " \
            + f"Grade {self.grade}"

# script

```

Let's break down some of the new features in the `Student` model:

#### Indexes

Indexes are used to speed up lookups on certain column values. Since teachers
and administrators don't typically know their student's ID numbers off the top
of their heads, it's wise to set up an index for `name` in preparation
for people using it in their database transactions.

#### `__repr__()`

All classes in Python have a `__repr__()` instance method that determines their
standard output value (i.e. what you see when you `print()` the object). By
default, this shows the classname and an arbitrary ID. This default value is not
very helpful in telling different objects apart. (At least not to humans.)

The `__repr__()` method in our refactored `Student` class will output a much more
helpful string:

```py
my_student = Student(...)
print(my_student)
# => Student 1: Joseph Smith, Grade 4
```

#### Input Sizes, Defaults, and More

SQLAlchemy provides a number of other optional arguments in the `Column` and
data-type constructors that will allow you to make your code more specific and
secure. Explore [the `Column` documentation][column] to learn more.

***

## Creating Records

Now that we have a session and a robust data model, let's start populating a
database.

To create a new student record in our database, we need to create an object
using the `Student` class. This syntax is the same as with instantiating any
other Python class.

> **Note**: while we can enter the data in order without argument names, we
> are going to use them consistently in class constructors when using
> SQLAlchemy. This is because it makes our code much more readable when working
> with tables with many columns.

```py
# imports, models

if __name__ == '__main__':

    engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    session = Session()

    albert_einstein = Student(
        name="Albert Einstein",
        email="albert.einstein@zurich.edu",
        grade=6,
        birthday=datetime(
            year=1879,
            month=3,
            day=14
        ),
    )
    
    session.add(albert_einstein)
    session.commit()

    print(f"New student ID is {albert_einstein.id}.")

```

Now when we run our script from the command line, we see the following:

```console
$ python app/sqlalchemy_sandbox.py
# => New student ID is 1.
```

After creating a `Student` object, `session.add()` generates a statement to
include in the session's transaction, then `session.commit()` executes all
statements in the transaction and saves any changes to the database.
`session.commit()` will also update your `Student` object with a `id`.

If we want to save multiple new records in a single line of code, we can use
the session's `bulk_save_objects()` instance method:

```py
# imports, models

if __name__ == '__main__':

    engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    session = Session()

    albert_einstein = Student(
        name="Albert Einstein",
        email="albert.einstein@zurich.edu",
        grade=6,
        birthday=datetime(
            year=1879,
            month=3,
            day=14
        ),
    )

    alan_turing = Student(
        name="Alan Turing",
        email="alan.turing@sherborne.edu",
        grade=11,
        birthday=datetime(
            year=1912,
            month=6,
            day=23
        ),
    )

    session.bulk_save_objects([albert_einstein, alan_turing])
    session.commit()

    print(f"New student ID is {albert_einstein.id}.")
    print(f"New student ID is {alan_turing.id}.")

```

Let's run the script again to see what we've got:

```console
$ python app/sqlalchemy_sandbox.py
# => New student ID is None.
# => New student ID is None.
```

Unfortunately, `bulk_save_objects()` does not associate the records with the
session, so we don't update our records' IDs. Take this into consideration when
creating records in your own code.

Run `app/sqlalchemy_sandbox.py` to make sure that there are no errors in your
code. Once you're seeing the same output as above, let's practice retrieving
these new records from the database.

***

## Read Records

There are many ways to structure a query in SQLAlchemy, but they all begin with
the session's `query()` instance method:

```py
# imports, models

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # create session, student objects

    session.bulk_save_objects([albert_einstein, alan_turing])
    session.commit()

    students = session.query(Student)

    print([student for student in students])

# => [Student 1: Albert Einstein, Grade 6, Student 2: Alan Turing, Grade 11]
```

We would see the same output using the `all()` instance method:

```py
# imports, models

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # create session, student objects

    session.bulk_save_objects([albert_einstein, alan_turing])
    session.commit()

    students = session.query(Student).all()

    print(students)

# => [Student 1: Albert Einstein, Grade 6, Student 2: Alan Turing, Grade 11]
```

<details>
  <summary>
    <em>Which method helps make an object's standard output human-readable?</em>
  </summary>

  <h3><code>__repr__()</code></h3>
</details>
<br/>

### Selecting Only Certain Columns

By default, the `query()` method returns complete records from the data model
passed in as an argument. If we're only looking for certain fields, we can
specify this in the arguments we pass to `query()`. Here's how we would retrieve
all of the students' names:

```py
# imports, models

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # create session, student objects

    names = session.query(Student.name).all()

    print(names)

# => [('Albert Einstein',), ('Alan Turing',)]
```

### Ordering

By default, results from any database query are ordered by their primary key.
The `order_by()` method allows us to sort by any column:

```py
# imports, models

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # create session, student objects

    students_by_name = session.query(
            Student.name).order_by(
            Student.name).all()

    print(students_by_name)

# => [('Alan Turing',), ('Albert Einstein',)]
```

<details>
  <summary>
    <em>What data type does <code>query()</code> return records in?</em>
  </summary>

  <h3><code>tuple</code></h3>
</details>
<br/>

To sort results in descending order, we need to use the `desc()` function from
the `sqlalchemy` module:

```py
# imports, models

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # create session, student objects

    students_by_grade_desc = session.query(
            Student.name, Student.grade).order_by(
            desc(Student.grade)).all()

    print(students_by_grade_desc)

# => [('Alan Turing', 11), ('Albert Einstein', 6)]
```

### Limiting

To limit your result set to the first `x` records, you can use the `limit()`
method:

```py
# imports, models

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # create session, student objects

    oldest_student = session.query(
            Student.name, Student.birthday).order_by(
            desc(Student.grade)).limit(1)

    print(oldest_student)

# => [('Alan Turing', datetime.datetime(1912, 6, 23, 0, 0))]
```

The `first()` method is a quick and easy way to execute a `limit(1)` statement
and does not require a list interpretation:

```py
# imports, models

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # create session, student objects

    oldest_student = session.query(
            Student.name, Student.birthday).order_by(
            desc(Student.grade)).first()

    print(oldest_student)

# => ('Alan Turing', datetime.datetime(1912, 6, 23, 0, 0))
```

### `func`

Importing `func` from `sqlalchemy` gives us access to common SQL operations
through functions like `sum()` and `count()`. As these operations act upon
columns, we carry them out through wrapping a `Column` object passed to the
`query()` method:

```py
# imports, models

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # create session, student objects

    student_count = session.query(func.count(Student.id)).first()

    print(student_count)

# => (2,)
```

It is best practice to call these functions as `func.operation()` rather than
their name alone because many of these functions have name conflicts with
functions in the Python standard library, such as `sum()`.

### Filtering

Retrieving specific records requires use of the `filter()` method. A typical
`filter()` statement has a column, a standard operator, and a value. It is
possible to chain multiple `filter()` statements together, though it is
typically easier to read with comma-separated clauses inside of one `filter()`
statement.

```py
# imports, models

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # create session, student objects

    query = session.query(Student).filter(Student.name.like('%Alan%'),
        Student.grade == 11)

    for record in query:
        print(record.name)

# => Alan Turing
```

***

## Updating Data

There are several ways to update data using SQLAlchemy ORM. The simplest is to
use Python to modify objects directly and then commit those changes through the
session. For instance, let's say that a new school year is starting and our
students all need to be moved up a grade:

```py
# imports, models

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # create session, student objects

    for student in session.query(Student):
        student.grade += 1
    
    session.commit()

    print([(student.name,
        student.grade) for student in session.query(Student)])

# => [('Albert Einstein', 7), ('Alan Turing', 12)]
```

The `update()` method allows us to update records without creating objects
beforehand. Here's how we would carry out the same statement with `update()`:

```py
# imports, models

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # create session, student objects

    session.query(Student).update({
        Student.grade: Student.grade + 1
    })
    
    print([(
        student.name,
        student.grade
    ) for student in session.query(Student)])

# => [('Albert Einstein', 7), ('Alan Turing', 12)]
```

> **Note**: chaining of filters and query methods is possible because each
> method returns a modified version of the original object. Though certain
> attributes have changed, the returned object still has access to the same
> methods as the original object.

***

## Deleting Data

To delete a record from your database, you can use the `delete()` method. If
you have an object in memory that you want to delete, you can call the
`delete()` method on the object from your `session`:

```py
# imports, models

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # create session, student objects

    query = session.query(
        Student).filter(
            Student.name == "Albert Einstein")        

    # retrieve first matching record as object
    albert_einstein = query.first()

    # delete record
    session.delete(albert_einstein)
    session.commit()

    # try to retrieve deleted record
    albert_einstein = query.first()
    
    print(albert_einstein)

# => None
```

If you don't have a single object ready for deletion but you know the criteria
for deletion, you can call the `delete()` method from your query instead:

```py
# imports, models

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # create session, student objects

    query = session.query(
        Student).filter(
            Student.name == "Albert Einstein")

    query.delete()

    albert_einstein = query.first()

    print(albert_einstein)

# => None
```

This strategy will delete all records returned by your query, so be careful!

***

## Conclusion

This has been a _very_ long lesson, but hopefully you've gotten some good
practice performing CRUD on databases with SQLAlchemy. Remember that
**sessions** allow us to interact with databases through SQLAlchemy and that
those interactions are grouped into **transactions**. There are hundreds of
methods, operations, and filter criteria available in SQLAlchemy, so make sure
to keep the [SQLAlchemy ORM documentation][sqlaorm] nearby as you finish up
Phase 3!
